- DeathScreen image:

"I am releasing I Wanna Be the Guy's source code right now. I'm not going to make up a fancy license or anything, I'm just going to tell you what is and is not acceptable.

You may release variants/rom hacks THAT ARE PROPERLY LABELED.

You may yank out engines and code and use them freely.

You may take credit for any work you do, just exercise good taste. Do not do a few changes to IWBTG and act like it's your own work. If you use and borrow code, just credit me for that -- the rest of the work is clearly yours though.

You, as a COMMUNITY, may (and should) try and band together to fix up the main game for a new, bugfixed release."

Classy as fuck. Really good handling of the situation.

Freeware is usually distributed with a license that permits its redistribution to some extent, for example allowing users to give copies to friends. However, there may be restrictions, such as limitations on its commercial use. Some licenses permit the software to be freely copied but not sold.

(Note: No code was ripped, only the death image)
